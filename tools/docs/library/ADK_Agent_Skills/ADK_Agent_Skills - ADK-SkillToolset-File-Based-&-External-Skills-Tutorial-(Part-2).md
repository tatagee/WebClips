In Part 1, we covered progressive disclosure — the L1/L2/L3 pattern that keeps agent context small — and built an inline SEO checklist skill in Python. Inline skills are fast to write, but the knowledge lives only in your code. This post moves beyond Python strings into ADK skills that live on disk, come from community repos, and get wired into a working agent.

By the end of this post, you’ll know how to:

- Load **file-based skills** from directories with SKILL.md and reference documents
- Integrate **external skills** from community repositories like [awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills)
- Wire all skills into a single `SkillToolset` and understand its **three auto-generated tools**
- See **multi-skill loading** in action with ADK Web

> [!tip] Tip
> - **File-based skills** store knowledge as SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter, making skills reusable and version-controllable
> - **External skills** load from community repos (like awesome-claude-skills), letting you import pre-built expertise
> - `SkillToolset` auto-generates three tools from any skill collection: `list_skills`, `get_skill_details`, and `load_skill_resource`
> - ADK validates skill names at import time — duplicate names raise a `ValueError` immediately, not at runtime

## Pattern 2: File-Based ADK Skills

A **file-based skill** in ADK is a skill stored as a directory containing a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description`) and Markdown instructions, plus optional `references/`, `assets/`, and `scripts/` subdirectories for L3 resources.

The SEO checklist worked as an inline skill because it was self-contained — nine rules, no external files. The blog writer skill needs more: a style guide with voice rules, formatting conventions, and anti-patterns. That reference document doesn’t belong inline as a Python string. This is where [file-based skills](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/skills/#define-skills-with-files?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) pick up.

A file-based skill lives in its own directory with a SKILL.md file and optional subdirectories for references, assets, and scripts. The SKILL.md starts with YAML frontmatter, followed by Markdown instructions.

```markdown
# skills/blog-writer/SKILL.md

---

name: blog-writer

description: Blog post writing skill with structure templates and style guidelines.

  Guides the agent through writing well-structured, engaging technical blog posts

  with proper formatting, section flow, and reader engagement techniques.

---

# Blog Writer Instructions

When asked to write a blog post, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Structure

Use \`load_skill_resource\` to read \`references/style-guide.md\` for the writing style rules.

## Step 2: Outline First

Before writing, create a brief outline with:

- **Hook**: Opening that grabs attention

- **Context**: Why this topic matters now

- **Core sections**: 3-5 sections that build on each other

- **Takeaway**: What the reader walks away knowing

...
```

The design splits knowledge across two layers. The SKILL.md instructions (L2) tell the agent *what steps to follow*. The `references/style-guide.md` file (L3) provides the *detailed knowledge* for each step — voice guidelines, formatting conventions, anti-patterns to avoid. The agent loads the reference only when its instructions say to, via `load_skill_resource`.

> [!important] Important
> The directory name **must** match the `name` field in SKILL.md frontmatter. `blog-writer/` requires `name: blog-writer`. Mismatches cause a validation error from `load_skill_from_dir` — no partial matches, no fallbacks.

Loading a file-based skill in Python is one line.

```python
# agent.py — Pattern 2: File-Based Skill

blog_writer_skill = load_skill_from_dir(

    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "skills" / "blog-writer"

)
```

When the agent used this skill to write a blog introduction, I could see it first loading the skill instructions (L2), then pulling the style guide via `load_skill_resource` (L3). The style guide’s influence was visible in the output — short paragraphs, no “In today’s rapidly evolving…” openings, action-oriented headings.

![Agent loads style-guide.md via load_skill_resource to apply writing rules to blog output](https://lavinigam.com/posts/adk-agent-skills-part2/l3-resource-loading.webp)

L3 in action: the agent calls load\_skill\_resource(“blog-writer”, “references/style-guide.md”) to fetch the detailed writing rules on demand.

File-based skills make the knowledge reusable — any agent that follows the agentskills.io spec can load the same `blog-writer/` directory. But you still wrote the SKILL.md yourself. What if someone else already wrote the skill you need?

## Pattern 3: External ADK Skills from Community Repos

An **external skill** is a file-based skill loaded from a source outside your project — typically a community repository like awesome-claude-skills — that provides pre-built domain expertise your agent can use without you writing the instructions yourself.

External skills work exactly like file-based skills — the only difference is where the directory came from. Instead of writing your own SKILL.md, you download one from a community repository and load it with the same `load_skill_from_dir` call.

External skills aren’t limited to community repos. Google publishes [official ADK development skills](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/skills?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) — covering the dev guide, cheatsheet, evaluation, deployment, observability, and scaffolding — installable with `npx skills add google/adk-docs -y -g`. These are first-party external skills that follow the same agentskills.io spec, loadable via `load_skill_from_dir` just like the community `content-research-writer` skill below.

The [`content-research-writer`](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills/blob/master/content-research-writer/SKILL.md) skill in this agent is adapted from [Composio’s awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills) repository, which has over 100 production skills for various domains. The workflow for loading an external skill:

1. **Find** a skill that fits your use case in a community repo
2. **Clone or download** the skill directory into your project’s `skills/` folder
3. **Verify** the SKILL.md frontmatter is valid (`skills-ref validate ./my-skill` if you have the [validation tool](https://agentskills.io/specification?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) )
4. **Review** the instructions and reference files — then load it

> [!warning] Warning
> A skill’s instructions become your agent’s behavior. Always read the SKILL.md and any reference files before loading an external skill. Treat it like a dependency review — you’re giving the LLM new instructions.

```python
# agent.py — Pattern 3: External Skill

content_researcher_skill = load_skill_from_dir(

    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "skills" / "content-research-writer"

)
```

The code is identical to Pattern 2. That’s the point — the [agentskills.io spec](https://agentskills.io/specification?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) defines a universal directory format, so `load_skill_from_dir` doesn’t care whether you wrote the SKILL.md or downloaded it.

The content-research-writer skill includes a 5-phase research methodology with detailed SEO guidelines in `references/seo-guidelines.md`. All of that knowledge becomes available to the agent with one line of code, no rewriting needed.

File-based and external skills cover most use cases — you either write the skill or find one that exists. But what if the skill you need doesn’t exist in any repo? Part 3 answers that question with a meta skill that generates new skills on demand.

## Wiring ADK Skills with SkillToolset

**SkillToolset** is ADK’s built-in `BaseToolset` subclass that converts any collection of Agent Skills into three auto-generated tools — `list_skills` (returns L1 metadata for all skills), `get_skill_details` (loads L2 instructions for a specific skill), and `load_skill_resource` (fetches L3 reference files).

With all four skills defined (inline SEO checklist from Part 1, file-based blog writer, external content researcher, and the meta skill-creator coming in Part 3), the final step is packaging them into a [`SkillToolset`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/src/google/adk/tools/skill_toolset.py?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) and handing it to the agent.

```python
# agent.py — Assemble and wire up

skill_toolset = SkillToolset(

    skills=[seo_skill, blog_writer_skill, content_researcher_skill, skill_creator]

)

root_agent = Agent(

    model="gemini-2.5-flash",

    name="blog_skills_agent",

    description="A blog-writing agent powered by reusable skills.",

    instruction=(

        "You are a blog-writing assistant with specialized skills.\n\n"

        "You have four skills available:\n"

        "- **seo-checklist**: SEO optimization rules\n"

        "- **blog-writer**: Writing structure and style guide\n"

        "- **content-research-writer**: Research methodology\n"

        "- **skill-creator**: Generate new skill definitions\n\n"

        "When the user asks you to write, research, or optimize:\n"

        "1. Load the relevant skill(s) to get detailed instructions\n"

        "2. Use load_skill_resource to access reference materials\n"

        "3. Follow the skill's step-by-step instructions\n\n"

        "Always explain which skill you're using and why."

    ),

    tools=[skill_toolset],

)
```

The agent’s `instruction` explicitly lists the four skills. This overlaps with `SkillToolset` ’s auto-injected listing, but serves a different purpose — the instruction provides a stable hint about the agent’s identity, while the dynamic `list_skills` injection gives the LLM structured metadata for each request.

### Under the Hood: Three Auto-Generated Tools

`SkillToolset` is not a regular tool — it’s a [`BaseToolset`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/src/google/adk/tools/skill_toolset.py?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog), which means its `get_tools()` method is called on every LLM step. It auto-registers three tools that map directly to progressive disclosure:

- **`list_skills`** (L1) — Returns an XML listing of all skill names and descriptions. Injected into the system context automatically via `process_llm_request()` — the agent never calls it explicitly. Always present, always lightweight.
- **`load_skill`** (L2) — Takes a skill name and returns its full instructions plus frontmatter. The agent calls this when it decides a skill is relevant to the current query.
- **`load_skill_resource`** (L3) — Takes a skill name and a file path, returning the content of a file from `references/`, `assets/`, or `scripts/`. Detailed knowledge loaded only on demand.
![SkillToolset flow showing list_skills injection, load_skill, and load_skill_resource tool sequence](https://lavinigam.com/posts/adk-agent-skills-part2/skilltoolset-flow.webp)

SkillToolset’s three auto-generated tools: list\_skills (L1, injected automatically), load\_skill (L2, on demand), and load\_skill\_resource (L3, on demand).

ADK Web’s agent graph view showing blog\_skills\_agent connected to the three SkillToolset tools, with function call arguments and token counts visible.

> [!note] Note
> `SkillToolset` validates skill names at construction time and raises a `ValueError` if any two skills share the same name. This happens at import time, not at runtime — so you’ll catch duplicates immediately.

Running the agent with [ADK Web](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/runtime/web-interface/?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) shows the progressive disclosure pattern visually.

> [!warning] Warning
> Use `adk web .` not `adk web app/` — pointing at `app/` directly makes ADK discover `skills/` as a separate app instead of treating `app/` as your app.

When I asked “Help me write a blog introduction and make it SEO-friendly”, the agent loaded both the `blog-writer` and `seo-checklist` skills in parallel — without being told to load both. The L1 metadata listing gave it enough context to decide both skills were relevant. It then called `load_skill_resource` to read the style guide, and produced an introduction that followed both skills’ instructions.

![Agent loads blog-writer and seo-checklist skills in parallel with load_skill_resource for style guide](https://lavinigam.com/posts/adk-agent-skills-part2/multi-skill-parallel-loading.webp)

Multi-skill loading: the agent autonomously loads both blog-writer and seo-checklist in the same turn, then fetches the style guide via load\_skill\_resource.

The ADK Web UI makes the flow visible through tool call badges. Each badge shows the tool name and its status (pending → complete). In this interaction, four events fired: `load_skill("blog-writer")` and `load_skill("seo-checklist")` in the same turn, followed by `load_skill_resource("references/style-guide.md")`, and finally the agent’s written response.

The agent’s reasoning is also interesting in the negative case. When I asked “Can you use your video-editing skill to create a thumbnail?”, the agent checked the L1 listing and correctly responded that it has no video-editing skill. It listed all four available skills instead. No hallucination, no attempt to fake a capability it doesn’t have.

We’ve covered skills that exist — skills you write yourself (inline, file-based) or find in community repos (external). We’ve wired them into a `SkillToolset` and seen multi-skill loading in action. This tutorial is part of the [full Agent Engineering series](https://lavinigam.com/series/agent-engineering/) by [Lavi Nigam](https://lavinigam.com/about/) — see for related posts.

In **Part 3**, the agent writes its own skills. We’ll build a meta skill-creator that generates new SKILL.md files on demand, reflect on what skills change about agent behavior, and explore what’s coming next for the pattern.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I mix file-based and inline skills in the same SkillToolset?** Yes. `SkillToolset` accepts any list of skill sources. You can combine inline Python dicts, file-based skill directories, and external skill paths in a single `skills=[]` parameter. The toolset treats them identically once loaded.

**What happens if a SKILL.md file has invalid YAML frontmatter?** ADK’s skill loader will raise a parsing error at import time, before your agent starts. The frontmatter must include valid YAML with at least `name` and `description` fields. Missing or malformed frontmatter prevents the skill from loading.

**What are the three tools auto-generated by SkillToolset?** `list_skills` returns L1 metadata (name and description) for all registered skills. `get_skill_details` loads the full L2 instructions for a specific skill by name. `load_skill_resource` fetches L3 reference files from a skill’s `references/` directory. The agent calls these tools autonomously based on the user’s query.

**Is there a size limit for SKILL.md files or L3 resources?** The Agent Skills specification does not impose hard size limits, but practical constraints apply. L2 instructions should fit within the model’s context window alongside the conversation. L3 resources are loaded individually, so each file should be self-contained and reasonably sized (a few thousand tokens).

**How does SkillToolset handle duplicate skill names?** It raises a `ValueError` at import time if any two skills share the same `name` field. This happens before the agent starts, so you get an immediate, clear error rather than confusing runtime behavior.

**Can I load ADK Core Skills with SkillToolset?** Yes. Google publishes [official ADK development skills](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/skills?utm_campaign=adk-agent-skills-part2&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=lavinigam-blog) as standard SKILL.md directories. Since they follow the agentskills.io specification, you can load them with `load_skill_from_dir` exactly like any file-based or external skill. Install with `npx skills add google/adk-docs -y -g`, then point `load_skill_from_dir` at the installed directory.
